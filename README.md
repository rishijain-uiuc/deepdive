Energy prices are a function of demand, however, that demand can be influenced by several ways. This project aims to predict energy prices in Illinois based on features that are known in advance, such as: day of the week, hour of day, month, predicted weather, day-ahead energy price, and energy prices in neighboring states. With predicted prices, customers can make more informed decisions about their energy consumption and potentially alter their behavior to consume energy when it is expected to be the cheapest. <br /> <br />

This project will use use deep learning techniques learned in class to the model and train the data to predict energy prices. This readme wili continue to be updated throughotu the development of the project.
